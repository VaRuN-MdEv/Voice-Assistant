Voice Assistant
This repository contains a fully functional voice assistant built with various Python libraries, designed to provide seamless and intelligent voice interactions. The assistant is capable of recognizing speech, generating responses, and integrating with external services.

Key Features:
Speech Recognition: Utilizes speech_recognition for accurate voice input processing, allowing the assistant to understand and respond to spoken commands.
Text-to-Speech (TTS): Powered by pyttsx3, enabling the assistant to deliver natural voice responses, making conversations more interactive.
Real-time Interaction: streamlit is used to create a user-friendly interface for real-time voice interactions, making it easy to deploy the assistant on web applications.
Time and Date Integration: With datetime, the assistant can handle time-based queries, such as checking the current time or date.
API Requests: Leverages requests to make API calls for fetching external data (e.g., weather updates, news).
Generative AI: Integrated with Google's GenerativeModel (via the google.generativeai API) for enhanced conversational AI, allowing the assistant to generate context-aware responses.
Randomized Responses: Uses Python's random module to introduce variety in responses, providing a more natural conversational experience.
Efficient Processing: time ensures efficient handling of time-based events and delays when necessary.
This voice assistant can be easily extended to include additional commands and functionalities. Whether it's for personal use or customer service applications, it can be customized and integrated with various APIs and services.
